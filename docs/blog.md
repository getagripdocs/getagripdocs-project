# First trip out

We (Nils and William) had a weekend excursion to Stavanger, where the headquarters of Bolder 
are located.

They had multiple floors, which included offices, a makerspace, lunch areas, silent rooms,
and more.

The tools available included 3d printers, cnc machines, and a lathe.

But most importantly; a pancake printer and a microbrewery.
